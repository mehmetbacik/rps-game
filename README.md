# Easybank Landing Page

A web-based implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game, with an **Advanced Mode** that includes **Lizard** and **Spock**. Built using React, TypeScript, SCSS, and Framer Motion, this game features responsive design, smooth animations, state management with Context API, and score persistence with LocalStorage.

## Features

- **Classic Mode**: Play the traditional **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game with three choices: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- **Advanced Mode**: In addition to the basic choices, play with **Lizard** and **Spock**, adding more complexity to the game.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive interface, ensuring a seamless user experience on devices of all sizes.
- **Framer Motion Animations**: Smooth, interactive animations that enhance the overall user experience.
- **Score Persistence**: LocalStorage is used to save the player's score across sessions, so no progress is lost when the page is refreshed.
- **State Management**: Context API is utilized to manage the game state globally across the application.

## Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to structure the gameâ€™s frontend.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and ensures type safety.
- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, providing fast performance for the game.
- **Framer Motion**: A powerful animation library for React, used to create smooth and interactive animations throughout the game.
- **SCSS**: A CSS preprocessor that enables the use of variables, nesting, and modular CSS, improving the maintainability of the styles.
- **Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework used to ensure the reliability and functionality of the codebase.
- **ESLint**: A static code analysis tool to ensure the code adheres to coding standards and prevents potential issues.
- **LocalStorage**: Used to persist player scores across sessions, allowing users to continue their game without losing progress.
- **React Context API**: Used for state management, allowing the sharing of game state (e.g., choices, scores, results) across components.
